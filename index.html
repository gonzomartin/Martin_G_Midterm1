        <h1>The main problem of the legalization on 3rd world countries</h1>
    </header>    
        <p>When we talk about marihuana and 3rd world countries we have to acknowledge that here, almost all the drugs on the streets are managed by the guerrillas or the narcotrafic cartels. Its also important to say that the goverments also have a lot of realtion becouse drugs are the way to buy and control the country and all their workers. What is happening right now on some countries is that the goverment is getting noticce that legalization does come with a lot of money behind their arm, so the now are looking forward to legalize at any cost to win place on a empty market so at the end, truly, is all about money. </p>
